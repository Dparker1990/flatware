Feature: Distribute scenarios between workers
  In order to get feedback on my code as fast as possible
  I want to run more than one at a time

  Scenario:
    Given I am using a multi core machine
    And a sleepy cucumber suite
    When I time the suite with cucumber
    And I time the suite with flatware
    Then flatware is faster
